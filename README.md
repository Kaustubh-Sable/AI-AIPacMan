# AI : PacMan
Implemented following search Algorithms for PACMAN in groups of two along with Komal Agarwal for the course of CSE 537 (AI):
- BFS
- DFS
- UCS
- A* Search
- Corners Problem : A* Search with custom heuristics
- FoodSearch Problem with heuristics

The following search algorithms are implemented in a different module [here](https://github.com/Kaustubh-Sable/AI_Projects/tree/master/Pacman-GameSearchProblems):
- Reflex Agent
- Minmax Agent
- Alpha Beta Pruning
- Expectimax Agent
